You can add other buttons from other social networks, just use the "share function" of the site, facebook for example is "https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=" remember to use the icon also, example "fa fa-youtube", that way the icon appears, for each icon it is necessary to create a style with background and button color.

Note: the WhatsApp button I preferred to remove on the desktop using @media min-width, but you can put it back.

when you see the code you understand how everything works, I added an option to copy the URL as well.
