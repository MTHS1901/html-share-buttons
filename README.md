Below you can see how it works on mobile devices and computers.

You can add other buttons from other social networks, just use the "share function" of the site, facebook for example is "https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=" remember to use the icon also, example "fa fa-youtube", that way the icon appears, for each icon it is necessary to create a style with background and button color.

Note: the WhatsApp button I preferred to remove on the desktop using @media min-width, but you can put it back.

when you see the code you understand how everything works, I added an option to copy the URL as well.
